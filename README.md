# API-Golang
this is simple project for creating API using Go.
I'm open for any improvement on this code for learning purpose.

#Tech Spec
there are several libraries that I used on this project <br>
<ul> 
  <li> for creating the route using [httprouter](	https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) </li>
  <li> for connecting to mysql databse using [mysql](	https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql) </li>
</ul>

I hope this repository could help you to learn some basic developing API using Go.
